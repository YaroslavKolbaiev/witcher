As other such creatures, they are hardly hurt by steel but very vulnerable to silver.There are two most common ways to aquire lycanthropy: the first one through a curse[2] and the second is to simply have a werewolf parent. Being bitten by another werewolf, while popular in folk tales, gives only a very small chance of becoming one in reality, though it is still recommended to get magical treatment.",

Bruxa are very agile and only silver swords are effective against them. While they have sharp claws for close up attacks, they can also let out a piercing scream from further away that can send even a grown man flying through the air. Only Quen is able to counter it, although the power of the cry can even break through it in certain situations.",

She only comes out on a full moon to hunt, fighting with incredible speed and strength. There is not much known about the curse that turns females into striga. The only well-documented example of a striga's lifetime was that of Adda the White, daughter of Foltest, king of Temeria. She was cursed prior to her birth, then born a striga.",
